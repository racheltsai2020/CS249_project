# CS249 Project
CS 249 project: Distributed Neural Networks for servers and devices in Heterogeneous Network Environments
By Huy Le, Rachel Tsai, Zi Yang Zhang

How to set up/compile the project:
The project was coded on Google Colab.
Here is the link to the Colab: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q_z-D5ScQKtSGVYJ6VgbjSvsqOKuxNyp/view?usp=sharing
Link to GitHub (same project, uploaded on a different platform): https://github.com/racheltsai2020/CS249_project
Instructions for running on Google Colab:
1. Open the file on Colab
2. Run each cell in sequential order

Instructions for accessing the project from GitHub:
1. Download the project
2. Open the file on Colab
3. Run each cell in sequential order
Note: Sometimes on Google Colab, when you press Run All, the cells may not run in order

Division of Work:
Huy Le: Bully Algorithm
Zi Yan Zhang: Minimum Spanning Tree
Rachel: Gossip Protocol
Everyone contributed: Security (RSA digital signature), Resource Allocation (prototype: Greedy and Round Robin) implemented but not incorporated into the system
